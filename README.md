# IOS Decal Final Project

I made a basic language review app that has flashcards for learning the words (with mnemonics) and a quiz section to test your knowledge. The plan is to build a better way to learn languages that is more fun. I want to make goof off time into productive time. A great way to do that is through games. 

The name "Cross Cards" comes from the eventual combination of flash cards and a crossword puzzle.
